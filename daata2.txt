The environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally on Earth,
 including the air we breathe, the water that covers over 70% of the planet's surface, the 
 soil that supports plant life, and the diverse ecosystems that house countless species of 
 flora and fauna. Human activities, particularly since the Industrial Revolution, 
 have dramatically altered the environment. For instance, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
 in the atmosphere has increased from about 280 parts per million (ppm) in pre-industrial times to over 415 ppm in 2023,
  contributing significantly to global warming. This increase in greenhouse gases has led to a rise
   in global average temperatures by approximately 1.1°C since the late 19th century.

Deforestation is another critical issue, with approximately 18 million acres of forest lost each year, 
primarily due to agricultural expansion. This not only contributes to carbon emissions but also results
 in the loss of habitat for countless species, leading to the extinction of about 137 species of plants,
  animals, and insects every day. The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth,"
   has lost about 17% of its forest cover in the past 50 years.

Oceans, covering over 70% of the Earth's surface, are also severely impacted by human activities.
 Over 8 million metric tons of plastic waste enter marine environments annually, causing significant 
 harm to marine life and ecosystems. Microplastics have been found in the deepest parts of the oceans,
  indicating the pervasive nature of plastic pollution. Coral reefs, which support about 25% of all
   marine species, are under threat from bleaching events caused by rising sea temperatures, 
   with 50% of the world’s coral reefs already lost or severely damaged.

Biodiversity loss is accelerating, with current extinction rates estimated to be 100 to 1,000
 times higher than the natural background rate. This loss of biodiversity not only disrupts 
 ecosystems but also impacts human health and livelihoods. For example, the decline in pollinator 
 populations threatens global food security, as about 75% of the world's crops rely on animal pollination.

Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly important in the fight against climate change.
 Wind and solar power capacities increased by 12% and 23%, respectively, in 2022. Despite these advances,
  fossil fuels still accounted for about 84% of global energy consumption in 2022, leading to a record
   high of 36.8 billion metric tons of energy-related CO2 emissions.

International agreements, like the Paris Agreement, aim to limit global warming to below 2°C
 above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. Achieving these 
 targets requires unprecedented global cooperation and action. Countries are required to submit 
 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) outlining their climate actions, but current commitments are
  insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement goals. Therefore, enhancing these commitments and implementing 
  effective policies is crucial for a sustainable future
